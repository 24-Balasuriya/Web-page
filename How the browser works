How Browser works
URL ---> Uniform Resource Locator

URL Formate:
scheme://domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering

scheme (or) protocol ---> these are HTTP or HTTPS or FTP
://    ---> separate scheme & rest of URL
domain ---> name of the server
port   ---> It allows to run multiple web services on a particular machine
path   ---> path to the resource 
query (optional)
fragment_id (optional)

When you click URL 
->Hpertext protocol command gets called on
->this command will be send across the network in search of the machine
->that is given in the domain name
->that machine will receive the request
->then it takes the path of the domain to find the database where the resource file is located
->then it will get the resouce file and return back to the server 
->the browser will accept the file and display the page.
